# FUTURE_CS_03 – API Security Risk Analysis

## Internship Track
Cyber Security – Future Interns

## Task Objective
The objective of this task is to analyze a publicly accessible API and identify common API security risks such as unauthenticated access, excessive data exposure, and lack of rate limiting.

This task focuses on understanding API security concepts from a defensive and analytical perspective rather than exploitation.

---

## API Selected
- **API Name:** JSONPlaceholder
- **Base URL:** https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
- **Purpose:** Public demo API providing fake data for testing and learning

---

## Methodology
The analysis was conducted using browser-based GET requests only. No authentication bypass, data modification, or intrusive testing was performed.

The following aspects were reviewed:
- Authentication & access control
- Data exposure in API responses
- Rate limiting (observational)
- General API security posture

---

## Tools Used
- Web Browser (Chrome / Edge)
- GitHub for documentation
- Word / Canva for report preparation

---

## Key Findings
- API endpoints are accessible without authentication
- Sensitive fields such as email addresses are exposed
- No visible rate-limiting controls were observed
- API is suitable for testing but would pose risks in production

---

## Deliverables
- API Security Risk Analysis Report (PDF)
- Screenshots of API responses as proof of analysis

All deliverables are available in the respective folders of this repository.

## Ethical Disclaimer
This task was completed strictly for educational purposes as part of a cybersecurity internship. Only publicly available demo APIs were analyzed. No exploitation or malicious activity was performed.
